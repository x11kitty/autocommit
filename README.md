<p align="center">
  <strong>A high-performance bash utility to automate GitHub commits and keep your contribution graph active.</strong>
</p>

---

### 📝 Overview
This tool handles the setup, authentication, and bulk-commit process for you. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and secure by using GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT) instead of storing raw passwords.

### 📋 Prerequisites
Before starting, you need a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**. This acts as your password for the script to push changes:

1. Go to your GitHub Settings (click your profile icon in the top right).
2. Scroll down on the left sidebar and click Developer settings.
3. Select Tokens (classic) under "Personal access tokens".
4. Click Generate new token -> Generate new token (classic).
5. Note: Give it a name (e.g., "AutoCommit").
6. Important: Check the repo checkbox (this allows the script to access your repositories).
7. Scroll to the bottom and click Generate token.
8. Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again.

### 🛠️ Installation & Setup
